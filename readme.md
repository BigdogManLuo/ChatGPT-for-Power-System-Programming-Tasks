This repository contains the numerical experiments for "LLMs for Power System Programming Tasks". We aim to provide an innovative solution for power system programming tasks using the large language model. By harnessing the capabilities of LLMs, power engineers can streamline their coding tasks, enhance productivity, and unlock new possibilities in power system programming.

## Overviewüì∞
The rapid digitalization of power systems has resulted in a significant surge in coding tasks for power engineers.

## Getting Startedüíæ

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖPython 3.7+ <br>
- ‚úÖPyTorch 1.8.0+ <br>

### Installation

Clone this repository and install the requirements:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatGPT-for-Power-System-Programming-Tasks.git
cd ChatGPT-for-Power-System-Programming-Tasks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Comprehensive Evaluation of Normal UC
take GPT4.0 as an example:
```shell
cd 01_normal_UC
python GPT4.0/x.x.py
...
```

### Accelerating UC
take 'success one' as an example, others are same.
```shell
cd success one
python generate_uc_instances.py
python main.py
```
