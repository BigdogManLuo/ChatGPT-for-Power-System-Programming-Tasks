This repository contains the numerical experiments for "LLMs for Power System Programming Tasks". We aim to provide an innovative solution for power system programming tasks using the large language model.

## Overviewüì∞

The rapid digitalization of power systems has resulted in a significant surge in coding tasks for power engineers.
