This repository contains the numerical experiments for "LLMs for Power System Programming Tasks". We aim to provide an innovative solution for power system programming tasks using the large language model.

## Overviewüì∞

The rapid digitalization of power systems has resulted in a significant surge in coding tasks for power engineers.

**Case Study 1Ô∏è‚É£: Normal Unit Commitment**

**Case Study 2Ô∏è‚É£: Accelerating Unit Commitment**
see '02_accelerating_UC'

This work corresponds to the paper [A framework for leveraging ChatGPT on programming tasks in energy systems
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11202), where we elaborate on our methodology, implementation details, and experimental results.
